This is a list of things to do. First is a list of tasks in the order they 
will be implemented. Following that is a scratchpad of ideas and things that
might be useful. These will either get fleshed out and turned into tasks or 
discarded.

## Tasks

Here is what is planned, roughly in the order it will be implemented:

## Ideas

* Improve type hints.

* Django is currently pinned to 3.2 as the autocomplete in the Admin does not 
  work with the latest version, 4.1.7 (Sept 2023). It is not clear whether this
  is an error in Django or whether it is a side-effect of using django-tagulous.

* Read through https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35684220 and fix any incompetence
  on the models.

* Make a first release so we can swap out the code for the app in the project 
  from which this all came from.

* Move the load_feeds task from the demo to a shared task in the app?

* Rename styles.css to site.css?

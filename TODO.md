# TODO

* Improve type hints.

* Django is currently pinned to 3.2 as the autocomplete in the Admin does not 
  work with the latest version, 4.1.7 (Sept 2023). It is not clear whether this
  is an error in Django or whether it is a side-effect of using django-tagulous.

* Read through https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35684220 and fix any incompetence
  on the models.

* Make a first release so we can swap out the code for the app in the project 
  from which this all came from.

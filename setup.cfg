#
# Django App Project
#
# Each of the tools used in the project have their configuration options
# defined here. The exception is black where the configuration is in
# pyproject.toml. There is a plugin for black,
# https://github.com/danie1k/python-black-configparser, that would allow
# the configuration to be located in setup.cfg. Since these are unlikely
# to change much it is not worth the extra dependency.
#
# All the various tools have their options synced to the values
# recommended for black since it's the most unforgiving of them all:
# https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/docs/compatible_configs.md

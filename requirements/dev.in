# Install the app and dependencies for development. It is done this way
# rather than using "setup.py develop" directly as that only makes Django
# visible to the app and not generally.

# CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Every time you recompile dev.in with pip-compile
# you MUST edit dev.txt to restore the entry for the feeds package to be
# a relative path, i.e. change the entry "-e file:///<path to>/django-feeds"
# to "-e ." otherwise you won't be able to build the images for the docker
# containers.

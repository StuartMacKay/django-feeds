Django Feeds is an aggregator for RSS and Atom feeds.

NOTE: The code actually works and has been in production for almost two 
years. However, everything is in a bit disorganised right now as it gets 
converted into an installable app. See the [TODO](TODO.md) for more details.

## Features

## Quick Start

## Demo

If you clone or download the [django-feeds](https://github.com/StuartMacKay/django-feeds) 
repository there is a demonstration application that lets you see how it 
all works.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:StuartMacKay/django-feeds.git
cd django-feeds
make install
make demo
``` 
It's a standard django project so if you don't have `make` available
then just look at the [Makefile](Makefile) and run the commands from
the various targets.
